Improve Access to Public Records

Problem Statement:
Help WSDOT improve access to public records: The service of an intern is proposed to assist with defining techniques to identify and proactively release data and documents that are commonly requested through the Public Disclosure Request process. The intern will engage with Records Management, IT Information Management, and the WSDOT Library to identify opportunities for building upon existing systems to facilitate safe public disclosures. This work will build upon previous UW Open Data Literacy intern work at WSDOT by continuing work with the IT Data Catalog metadata system to identify disclosable datasets, as well as working with an existing Public Disclosure Request database to identify repeatedly disclosed document sets for publication. The intern would investigate and propose extensions, revisions, or new processes for Records Management, the WSDOT Library, and WSDOTâ€™s data catalog to accommodate proactive processing of public interest and disclosable content.

Deliverables:
The intern, depending on their findings, may deliver a variety of results:
A heuristic, queryset, or technique for identifying commonly requested document sets from the Public Disclosure Request database
Analysis proposals for determining risk of sensitive data in requested or proposed disclosure datasets or documents
Proposed publication process (e.g., via appropriate committee reviews) for datasets based on risk assessment
Techniques for improving public discovery of commonly requested disclosure content which has been proactively posted
Techniques for cataloging of data and enabling discovery through the WSDOT Library
Results of testing previously proposed metadata attributes for open, structured data to determine applicability for unstructured data
Recommendations for implementation of proposed procedures/techniques
Final technical report/summary and presentation to WSDOT of all findings and recommendations

Skills Learned:
The intern will be exposed to and be provided the opportunity to learn skills for database analysis, querying, and reporting in actual operational settings. Interns may develop business analysis skills by working with a variety of clients to accomplish overarching objectives.

Intern will work a combination of remotely and at WSDOT.
